# House-Price-ML-Project
House Price Regression Machine Learning Project.

Problem Statement: 

Our goal is to predict the price of the houses using given independent variables. In the dataset, the target variable is "SalePrice" and the datatype of the target variable is continous numerical value.

Hypothesis Generation:

Without having the domain knowledge, we cannot do hypothesis generation, it is just a educated guess, we do before looking into the data. I have generated some hypothesis based on the knowledge I have in this domain. It is just a list of factors which have impact on our target variable.

1) Area of the house heavily impact the price of the house.

2) Newer buildings prices are always higher when compared to older buildings. House prices are inversely proportional to Building age.

3) Location of the house. If it is located in urban and semi urban area, the price of the house would be higher when compared to the houses in rural area.

4) Condition and number of bedrooms. The price of house will always be high if we have more numbers of bedrooms and the condition of the house is good.
